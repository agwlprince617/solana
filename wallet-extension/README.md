# Solana Wallet Chrome Extension

## Description

The **Solana Wallet Chrome Extension** is a lightweight and user-friendly browser extension that allows users to manage their Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency directly from their Chrome browser. With this extension, users can create a new wallet, send and receive SOL tokens, and view their transaction history, all within a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Features

- **Create New Wallet**: Generate a new Solana wallet with a unique keypair. The wallet's public and private keys are securely stored using the browser's `localStorage`.
  
- **Persistent Wallet**: The wallet information is stored persistently, meaning users can reload the browser or return at any time without losing their wallet data.

- **Send SOL Tokens**: Easily send SOL tokens to any recipient address on the Solana network. The extension supports specifying a fee-payer and allows transactions with unfunded recipients.

- **Receive SOL Tokens**: Share your public address with others to receive SOL tokens. The extension automatically updates the balance as transactions are confirmed.

- **View Transaction History**: Access a complete history of all transactions associated with your wallet, including details like transaction amount, sender, receiver, and transaction status.

- **Connect to Devnet**: The extension is configured to work with the Solana Devnet by default, making it ideal for development and testing purposes.
